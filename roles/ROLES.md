# Roles cards

These are the roles you can play. You need at least one C-level and one staff-level card.

The data format is a simple JSON with the structure:

{
    "title": "Staff",
    "description": "Normal staff employee. You may not take resources from the company pile.",
    "role: "STAFF"
}

{
    "title": "Boss",
    "description": "You may decide anything and use money from the company pile to spend and distribute.",
    "role: "MANAGEMENT"
}
