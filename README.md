# Security Deck Card Game
This card game aims to help people learn about security while playing out scenarios that could happen in real life - including your company! Practice incident responses, make trade-off decisions, keep the company alive or pursue other goals you might have. ;) Check out the [ROUNDS.md](ROUNDS.md) to learn about game mechanics.
