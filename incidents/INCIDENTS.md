# Incident cards

This folder holds incident cards describing security incidents which have happened at the company.
Depending on your current "oopsies" they may or may not have an impact on the company. The impact may vary,
e.g. loss of revenue due to loss of reputation, pay a fee or be put out of business, be charged and go to jail and loose the game.

The data format is a simple JSON with the structure:

{
    "title": "Website Defaced",
    "description": "Someone used your website to propagate hate speech",
    "condition": "Unpatched frontend vulnerability",
    "result: "Loose 25% revenue for the next 5 rounds"
}
