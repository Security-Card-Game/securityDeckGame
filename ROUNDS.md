# Game preparation

* Compile a deck of
* * X Incidents
* * Y Events
* * Z Oopsies
and make it a total of N cards without the incidents.
Split the cards into X + 1 piles. Add one incident to every pile but the first. Put the piles together. Do not mix. 


# Game start

* Have at least on C-LEVEL role and one staff role in the game
* For every 2 staff one C-LEVEL role is added, e.g.:
  * 3 players: 1 C-LEVEL, 2 STAFF
  * 4 players: 2 C-LEVEL, 3 STAFF
* Decide whether to distribute traits or not
* Add two times the monthly resources to the company pile
* Each player draws an event card and oopsies are revealed

# Rounds

* Move N resources to the company resource pile
* Distribute the resources if there are fixed budgets or discuss how to distribute them
* Draw a card: Events, Oopsies and Incidents are revealed immediately for everyone to see; do not show any Lucky cards you might have drawn and keep them to yourself
* Decide how to respond to the card (e.g. fix an Oopsie, resolve an Incident)
* The round ends
* Lucky cards may be played at any time

# Game end

You made it to the game without being put out of business by an incident? Now it's time for a shareholder meeting. Note how many resources your company can
acquire monthly and how many resources are left in the company pile. Try to maximize both values.
