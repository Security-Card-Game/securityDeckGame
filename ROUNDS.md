# Game preparation

* Compile a deck of
  * Attacks
  * Events
  * Oopsies
  * Lucky cards
and make it a total of N cards without the attacks.
Split the cards into X + 1 piles. Add one attack to every pile but the first. Put the piles together. Do not mix. 

# The preliminary rules

1. Collect your resources for the round
2. Draw a card openly
    * Event, Oopsies and Lucky cards are kept on the board
    * Attack cards are evaluated, if there is a matching target the attack strikes. However, there may be cards allowing you to stop the attack immediately.
3. Close Oopsies
    * Each Oopsie has a range of fix cost, you need to randomly determine a number in this range
    * You must take into account modifying cards which are open
    * You may use other modifying cards if you want to
    * If you have not enough resources to close the Oopsie, your resources will be set to 0 and the Oopsie will be kept open

# Game start

* Have at least on C-LEVEL role and one staff role in the game
* For every 2 staff one C-LEVEL role is added, e.g.:
  * 3 players: 1 C-LEVEL, 2 STAFF
  * 4 players: 2 C-LEVEL, 3 STAFF
* Decide whether to distribute traits or not
* Add two times the monthly resources to the company pile
* Each player draws an event card and Oopsies are revealed

# Rounds

* Move N resources to the company resource pile
* Distribute the resources if there are fixed budgets or discuss how to distribute them
* Draw a card: Events, Oopsies and Attacks are revealed immediately for everyone to see; do not show any Lucky cards you might have drawn and keep them to yourself
* Decide how to respond to the card (e.g. fix an Oopsie, counter an Attack)
* The round ends
* Lucky cards may be played at any time

# Game end

You made it to the game without being put out of business by an attack? Now it's time for a shareholder meeting. Note how many resources your company can
acquire monthly and how many resources are left in the company pile. Try to maximize both values.
