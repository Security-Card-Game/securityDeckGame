# Attack cards

This folder holds attack cards describing possible security incidents which have happened at the company.
Depending on your current "oopsies" they may or may not have an impact on the company. The impact may vary,
e.g. loss of revenue due to loss of reputation, pay a fee or be put out of business, be charged and go to jail and lose the game.
