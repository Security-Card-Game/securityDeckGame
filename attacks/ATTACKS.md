# Attack cards

This folder holds attack cards describing the actions of malicious actors that could possibly lead to security incidents at the company.
Depending on your current "oopsies" they may or may not have an impact on the company. The impact may vary,
e.g. loss of revenue due to loss of reputation, pay a fee or be put out of business, be charged and go to jail and lose the game.
